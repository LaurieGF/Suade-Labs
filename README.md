# Suade-Labs
There is a file called Metrics function for Suade Labs.ipynb. I have used Jupyter Notebook to create the required function, called metrics. To use it, make sure pandas is imported as pd, and type metrics(date), where date is of the form 'mm/dd/yyyy' (i.e. the American style with single quotation marks around it). It will output a dictionary similar to the example one.
When you click on Metrics function for Suade Labs.ipynb, it may not render properly. To see the file in HTML form, click on Raw. To see it as active code, copy and paste the web address into https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/.
